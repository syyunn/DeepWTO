The requested consultations\\nalso seek to address the imposition of a markup on sales of imported beef, the limitation of import\\nauthority to certain so-called \"super-groups\" and the Livestock Producers Marketing Organization\\n(\"LPMO\"), and the provision of domestic support to \\nthe cattle industry in Korea in amounts which\\ncause Korea to exceed Korea\\'s aggregate measure of support as reflected in Korea\\'s WTO schedule.\\nThe measures which restrict beef imports and the distribution and sale of imported beef\\nwithin Korea are the laws and regulations govern\\ning livestock trade in Korea, both domestic and\\nimported, and include the regulations covering sales of imported beef, the operational guidelines for\\n\\nthe Simultaneous Buy/Sell (SBS) system, and the guidelines concerning the registration and operation\\nof Specialized Imported Beef Stores.  Additional measures are described in Korea\\'s Livestock Act and\\nthe laws, decrees, and regulations relating to imposition of the markup and the subsidization of the\\ndomestic livestock industry, including the Livestock Industry Development Fund, the Livestock\\nProduct Processing and Treatment Act, the Customs Act, the International Trade Law, and the\\n\\nLivestock Farming Act.\\nThrough its restrictions on the importation, sale, display and distribution of imported beef and\\nthe imposition of a markup on imported beef, Korea appears to be imposing restrictions on market\\naccess that are inconsistent with its WTO obligations.  The restrictions on marketing and retail\\n\\ndistribution pertain only to imported beef and, thus, also appear to deny national treatment to beef\\nimports.  Finally, the provision by Korea of domestic subsidies to its cattle industry appears to have\\ncaused Korea to exceed the aggregate measure of support set forth in section IV of Korea\\'s WTO\\nschedule in contravention of Korea\\'s obligations under the Agreement on Agriculture.\\nWT/DS161/1, G/L/292,\\nG/AG/GEN/32, G/LIC/D/28\\nPage 2\\nAll of these measures appear to be inconsistent with the obligations of Korea under the\\nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, the Agreement on Agriculture, and the Agreement on\\nImport Licensing Procedures.
